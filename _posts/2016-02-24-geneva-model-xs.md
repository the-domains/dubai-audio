# Geneva Model XS 

## Wireless DAB+ / White
Wireless, FM, Alarm Clock, Speakers, Amplifier. All-in-One.  

The Geneva Sound System Model XS DAB+ is the world's first portable audio system with true Hi-Fi sound. Inspired by the classic travel clock, it comes in a sturdy leather-like clamshell case that flips open to deliver rich and detailed sound. Closed, it's a stylish accessory small enough to slip into any briefcase. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9cbe6098-55fd-48f7-9c9d-4fd9a3e81107.jpg)

Never before has a Hi-Fi system been integrated into a case designed for a travel lifestyle. Geneva Sound System Model XS DAB+ solves this problem with simplicity and elegance. It hides the speakers, amplifiers, radio, and alarm clock inside the case, covered in a choice of Geneva's trademark red, white or black finishes. 

Once opened, a compact yet powerful Hi-Fi system is revealed. The digital amplifier and stereo speakers play mid and high frequencies with absolute accuracy. The woofer is capable of producing robust bass response below 80Hz. The Model XS DAB+ features an integrated digital FM tuner and stereo Bluetooth playback. Music streams wirelessly to the Model XS DAB+ from any Bluetooth-enabled device, such as iPad, iPhone, and other smartphones and tablets. Other audio sources can be connected via the included 3.5 mm line-in cable. Advanced digital technology allows the Model XS DAB+ to produce stunning and expansive stereo sound that belies its compact size.
The Geneva Sound System Model XS DAB+ is not just another clock radio; it is a portable high-fidelity sound system!
